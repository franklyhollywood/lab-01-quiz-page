				<h2>History</h2>
				<p>
					Main article: History of skiing File:Ski-kampioen Jan Boon
					demonstreert op Duinrell.ogv Video demonstration of a variety of ski
					techniques used in the 1940s. Skiing has a history of almost five
					millennia.[1] Although modern skiing has evolved from beginnings in
					Scandinavia, it may have been practiced more than 100 centuries ago in
					what is now China, according to an interpretation of ancient
					paintings.[2][3] However, this continues to be debated.[4][5]
				</p>

				<p>
					The word "ski" is one of a handful of words that Norway has exported
					to the international community. It comes from the Old Norse word
					"skíð" which means "split piece of wood or firewood".[6]
				</p>

				<p>
					Asymmetrical skis were used in northern Finland and Sweden until at
					least the late 19th century. On one foot, the skier wore a long
					straight non-arching ski for sliding, and a shorter ski was worn on
					the other foot for kicking. The underside of the short ski was either
					plain or covered with animal skin to aid this use, while the long ski
					supporting the weight of the skier was treated with animal fat in a
					similar manner to modern ski waxing.
				</p>

				<p>
					Early skiers used one long pole or spear. The first depiction of a
					skier with two ski poles dates to 1741.[7]

				<h2>Types</h2>
				<h4>Alpine</h4>
				<p>
					Also called "downhill skiing", Alpine skiing typically takes place on
					a piste at a ski resort. It is characterized by fixed-heel bindings
					that attach at both the toe and the heel of the skier's boot. Ski
					lifts, including chairlifts, bring skiers up the slope. Backcountry
					skiing can be accessed by helicopter, snowcat, hiking and snowmobile.
					Facilities at resorts can include night skiing, après-ski, and glade
					skiing under the supervision of the ski patrol and the ski school.
					Alpine skiing branched off from the older Nordic type of skiing around
					the 1920s when the advent of ski lifts meant that it was no longer
					necessary to climb back uphill. Alpine equipment has specialized to
					the point where it can now only be used with the help of lifts. More
					recently the Alpine Touring variant has emerged, commonly referred to
					as "uphilling". AT setups use specialized bindings which are
					switchable between locked and free-heel modes. Climbing skins are
					temporarily attached to the bottom of alpine skis to give them
					traction on snow. This permits Nordic style uphill and back-country
					travel on alpine skis. For downhill travel the heels are locked and
					the skins are removed.
				</p>

				<h4>Nordic</h4>
				<p>
					The Nordic disciplines include cross-country skiing and ski jumping,
					which both use bindings that attach at the toes of the skier's boots
					but not at the heels. Cross-country skiing may be practiced on groomed
					trails or in undeveloped backcountry areas. Ski jumping is practiced
					in certain areas that are reserved exclusively for ski jumping.
				</p>

				<h4>Telemark</h4>
				<p>
					Telemark skiing is a ski turning technique and FIS-sanctioned
					discipline, which is named after the Telemark region of Norway. It
					uses equipment similar to Nordic skiing, where the ski bindings are
					attached only at the toes of the ski boots, allowing the skier's heel
					to be raised throughout the turn. However, the skis themselves are
					often the same width as Alpine skis.
